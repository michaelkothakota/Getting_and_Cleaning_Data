CODEBOOK - GETTING AND CLEANING DATA Project Coursera Course

The purpose of this file is to describe the variables, the dataset and how the data were cleaned for purposes of analysis.

-  The data was obtained from the following site in the form of a zip file below:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

from the following site:


http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

-  This data deals with Smartphones and collection on activities of the smartphone users.

  1.  The information about the variables is described in the above link.

Data parsing and cleaning

-  Although the run_analysis.R file is annotated, a brief description of what the script does is outlined in this document

  
  1.  First the data was downloaded, unzipped and placed in the working directory (*Note - make sure that you read the data from YOUR particular working directory)
  
  2.  The features of the data were read into RStudio using the read.table function.  The file was "features.txt.", which was assigned to the variable "features_data"
      The tables of the training set ("X_train.txt", "y_train.txt", "subject_train.txt) were read into RStudio using the "write.table" function
      Then the test set was read in using the same method
  
  3.  Variables were then extracted from the features dataset using the "with" command and the "gsub" command.
  
  4.  Using these particular transofrmations, this information was pulled from the training and test sets as well
  
  5.  The variables in the columns were combined using the cbind function for both the training and test sets, resulting in the dataset clean_data
  
  6.  Once this was completed for all files, the rbind function was used to merge the datasets and the activity names were concatenated into the dataset using the "c" command.
  
  7.  Two data files were written using the write.csv function, which were "clean_global" and "clean_average".  Clean average contained all of the averaged variables and grouped the observations
  
  8.  In order to upload the dataset on the coursera site, the write.table function was used (*Note:  This is not in the run_analysis.R program).
